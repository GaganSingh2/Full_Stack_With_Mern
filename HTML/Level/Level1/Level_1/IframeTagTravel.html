        Ladakh is a beautiful region located in the northern part of India.

        It is known as the “Land of High Passes” due to its mountainous terrain.

        Ladakh lies between the Karakoram and Himalayan mountain ranges.

        The region has a cold desert climate with very low rainfall.

        Leh is the largest town and an important tourist center in Ladakh.

        Ladakh is famous for its Buddhist monasteries, such as Hemis and Thiksey.

        The culture of Ladakh is strongly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism.

        Tourism in Ladakh includes trekking, river rafting, and bike trips.

        Pangong Lake and Nubra Valley are major attractions of Ladakh.

        Ladakh became a Union Territory of India in 2019.
